Your task is to remove chains of drops in the same colour. You can make only 90 degrees turns, i.e. straight left, straight right, straight up and down. The aim is to remove given number of all colours (panel on the left) in specified time (panel on the right). Moreover the longer chain you create means the smaller amount of clicks you do. In future this will state your position on the list of records (to do).
